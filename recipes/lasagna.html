    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Homemade lasagna may have a few steps, but each step is easy – and I assure you it’s worth the time; the perfect Italian meal!</p>
    <p>The ingredients in this recipe are all things you know and it’s not difficult at all! All you’ll need for this easy lasagna recipe is one pan, one bowl, and a 9×13 baking dish!</p>
    <p>A quick overview of the layers:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Cheese Filling</b>: Mix the ricotta and cheeses (per recipe below) with an egg in a bowl, and set aside. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!</li>
            <li><b>Meat Sauce</b>: Brown the onion, garlic, and meat in a pot on the stovetop. Add the pasta sauce and tomato paste & simmer a few minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Layer Together</b>: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with noodles and bake until bubbling</li>
        </ul>
