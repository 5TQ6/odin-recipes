        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>21 Salute Seasoning (or poultry seasoning)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>White wine or chicken broth</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, optional</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a large skillet, add the olive oil, pounded chicken, evenly season with 21 Salute, salt, pepper, and cook over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. Do not touch, move, or disturb the chicken while it is searing. After 5 minutes, flip chicken over. It should have a medium golden color. For thicker/bigger chicken breasts, sear for 6-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Allow chicken to cook on the second side for about 5 minutes, or until done and cooked through. Again, do not disturb the chicken while it's searing.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken with a slotted spatula and place it on a plate to rest.</li>
            <li>Using caution, deglaze your skillet by adding wine (or broth) and allow the liquid to bubble up and steam violently for a few seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the butter and allow it to melt, about 1 minute; stir continuously until melted.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minutes; stir continuously.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat off, add the chicken back into the skillet, flip it around in the garlic butter sauce, and spoon the sauce over the chicken.</li>
            <li>Optionally garnish with parsley and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
